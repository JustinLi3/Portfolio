                <h3 id="description2" class="w-75">Hello! I'm Justin Li, a dedicated and ambitious Computer Science student currently pursuing my Bachelor of Sciences at Rutgers University-New Brunswick, with a minor in Data Science. With a strong academic record, consistently making the Dean's List each semester, I am set to graduate in December 2025.

                    My passion lies in software development, where I've honed my skills in programming languages such as Java, Python, MySQL, HTML, CSS, C, and JavaScript. My proficiency extends to developer tools like Docker, Visual Studio, Brackets, Git, and Linux, as well as libraries including pandas and Tkinter. I hold several certifications from Codecademy, Coursera, and Udemy, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and professional growth.
                    
                    Throughout my academic journey, I've undertaken various projects that highlight my technical capabilities and problem-solving skills. From developing a File Integrity Checker using SHA-256 hashing to creating a captivating static clothing website, I've tackled a range of challenges with creativity and technical precision. Notably, I designed a Snake game with a dynamic graphical user interface and implemented Huffman coding for data compression, showcasing my versatility and depth of knowledge.
                    
                    In addition to my technical pursuits, I have gained valuable experience working at Kicky's Restaurant, where I manage reservations, address customer inquiries, and ensure timely deliveries. This role has strengthened my communication skills and ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment.
                    
                    Beyond academics and work, I am actively involved in various organizations such as USACS, SEED2S, and the Chinese Christian Fellowship. Volunteering for coastal cleanups and supporting marathon events reflects my commitment to community service. In my free time, I enjoy playing 8-ball pool, Sudoku, Valorant, weightlifting, thrifting, cooking, and exploring Korean R&B.</h3>
